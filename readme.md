# Jobizz App

Jobizz is a mobile application built with React Native that helps users find and apply for jobs. Below is a brief description of each component used in the application.

## Components

### Header
The `Header` component displays the user's name, email, and profile picture. It is typically used at the top of the screen to provide a personalized welcome.

### Search
The `Search` component consists of a search bar and a filter button. It allows users to search for jobs by entering keywords and apply filters to narrow down the search results.

### FeaturedJobs
The `FeaturedJobs` component showcases a list of highlighted job opportunities. It uses a horizontal `FlatList` to render job cards, each displaying the job title, company, location, salary, and relevant icons and background images.

### PopularJobs
The `PopularJobs` component displays a list of popular job listings. Each job card includes details such as the job title, company, location, salary, and an icon representing the company.

### Footer
The `Footer` component provides alternative login options using icons for Apple, Google, and Facebook. It also includes a registration prompt for new users.

### Form
The `Form` component contains input fields for the user to enter their name and email, along with a login button that navigates to the homepage upon submission.

### Login Header
The `Login Header` component provides a welcome message and brief instructions to the user about logging in and applying for jobs.

### HomePage
The `HomePage` component integrates the `Header`, `Search`, `FeaturedJobs`, and `PopularJobs` components into a single scrollable view, providing a comprehensive job browsing experience.

### Login
The `Login` component integrates the `Login Header`, `Form`, and `Footer` components, creating a complete login screen for the application.

## Styles
Each component comes with its own `StyleSheet` for styling various elements like text, images, and layout. These styles ensure a consistent and visually appealing user interface throughout the application.
